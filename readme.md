# Shopify to Bloomreach Discovery Integration

This project enables automated synchronization of Shopify product data into a Bloomreach Discovery catalog using a Dockerized workflow. It supports both **manual API triggers** and **Docker job execution**, with separation of concerns for maintainability and deployment flexibility. The system now includes **delta sync capabilities** for efficient incremental updates.

---

## üöÄ Project Structure

* **`job/`** ‚Äì Contains the Docker-based ingestion logic (Python-based). This folder is responsible for:

    * Extracting product data from Shopify via GraphQL bulk operations.
    * Supporting both full feeds and delta feeds (incremental updates).
    * Transforming data into Bloomreach-compatible format.
    * Uploading the final dataset via Bloomreach's Feed API.
    * Multi-market support with translations and market-specific URLs.

* **`api-server/`** ‚Äì Contains a Spring Boot REST API (Java-based) that:

    * Triggers Docker jobs on demand (full feeds).
    * Schedules and manages recurring delta feed jobs.
    * Monitors job execution status.
    * Manages security and cleanup via configurable cron jobs.
    * Provides automatic indexing capabilities.

These components are **loosely coupled** and can be run independently.

## üß± Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python (ETL job), Java (Spring Boot API server)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **APIs:** Shopify GraphQL, Bloomreach Feed API, Bloomreach Index API

## üì¶ Docker Job (Python) ‚Äì `job/`

This container automates:

1. Extraction of product and market data from Shopify (full or delta).
2. Transformation into a format compliant with Bloomreach Discovery.
3. Uploading to Bloomreach via the Feed API (PUT for full feeds, PATCH for delta feeds).
4. Optional automatic indexing after successful data upload.

### Feed Types

#### Full Feed (Default)
- Replaces entire product catalog
- Uses HTTP PUT to Bloomreach
- Processes all products in the store

#### Delta Feed
- Only processes products updated since last run
- Uses HTTP PATCH to Bloomreach
- Much faster for frequent updates
- Automatically calculates date ranges with 30-second overlap

### Multi-Market Support

For stores with multiple markets and translations:
- Fetches market-specific product URLs
- Includes translated product titles and descriptions
- Supports market data caching for efficient delta feeds

---

### Example Run

```bash
# Full feed
docker build -t dish-job ./job
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/export:/export \
  -e SHOPIFY_URL=shop.myshopify.com \
  -e SHOPIFY_PAT=your_token \
  -e BR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production \
  -e BR_ACCOUNT_ID=1234 \
  -e BR_CATALOG_NAME=my-catalog \
  -e BR_API_TOKEN=br_token \
  -e BR_OUTPUT_DIR=/export \
  -e AUTO_INDEX=true \
  dish-job

# Delta feed
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/export:/export \
  -e SHOPIFY_URL=shop.myshopify.com \
  -e SHOPIFY_PAT=your_token \
  -e BR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production \
  -e BR_ACCOUNT_ID=1234 \
  -e BR_CATALOG_NAME=my-catalog \
  -e BR_API_TOKEN=br_token \
  -e BR_OUTPUT_DIR=/export \
  -e DELTA_MODE=true \
  -e START_DATE=2025-07-16T12:00:00+00:00 \
  dish-job
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource Considerations

When running the `job/` component standalone (especially with large Shopify catalogs), **you may need to increase Docker's allocated memory**.

The container performs in-memory transformations and multi-step processing. To avoid `MemoryError`, it's recommended to:

* Allocate **at least 4GB of RAM** to Docker Desktop
* Use the `--memory` and `--memory-swap` flags if running via `docker run`:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --memory=4g \
  --memory-swap=4g \
  -v $(pwd)/export:/export \
  ... # (other flags)
  dish-job
```

## üß† API Server (Java) ‚Äì `api-server/`

The API server provides an interface for programmatically managing ingestion jobs and scheduling delta feeds.

### Features

* **One-time Jobs**: Create full feed jobs via `/dish/createJob`
* **Delta Scheduling**: Schedule recurring delta feeds via `/dish/scheduleDeltaJob`
* **Job Monitoring**: Check job status via `/dish/statusJob` and `/dish/statusJobs`
* **Task Management**: List and cancel scheduled delta tasks
* **Auto-indexing**: Optional automatic index triggering after successful feeds
* **Automatic cleanup**: Scheduled removal of old containers

## üîÑ Delta Feed Architecture

### How Delta Feeds Work

1. **Scheduling**: API server schedules recurring jobs using Spring's `@Scheduled` with cron expressions
2. **State Tracking**: File-based tracking of last successful run timestamps per catalog
3. **Date Calculation**: Automatic calculation of start dates with 30-second overlap for safety
4. **GraphQL Filtering**: Uses Shopify's `updated_at:>` query parameter to fetch only changed products
5. **API Method**: Uses HTTP PATCH instead of PUT for incremental updates
6. **Conflict Handling**: Skips execution if previous delta job is still running

### Delta Feed Benefits

- **Faster Processing**: Only processes changed products
- **Reduced Load**: Less impact on Shopify and Bloomreach APIs
- **Frequent Updates**: Enables near real-time catalog synchronization
- **Bandwidth Efficient**: Smaller data transfers

### Market Data Caching

For multi-market delta feeds, market data is cached to improve efficiency:
- Market data is cached for 24 hours by default
- Delta feeds reuse cached market data if still fresh
- Full feeds always refresh market data cache

---

## üõ† GraphQL Query Types

The system automatically selects the appropriate GraphQL query based on configuration:

1. **Standard**: `export_data_job.graphql` - Full feed, no translations
2. **Translations**: `export_data_job_translations.graphql` - Full feed with translations
3. **Delta**: `export_data_job_delta.graphql` - Delta feed, no translations  
4. **Delta + Translations**: `export_data_job_delta_translations.graphql` - Delta feed with translations

---

## üìù Example API Usage

### Schedule a Delta Feed

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/dish/scheduleDeltaJob \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-dish-access-token: your-secret-token" \
  -d '{
    "shopifyUrl": "your-store.myshopify.com",
    "shopifyPat": "your_pat_token",
    "brEnvironmentName": "production",
    "brAccountId": "1234",
    "brCatalogName": "your-catalog",
    "brApiToken": "your_br_token",
    "brMultiMarket": false,
    "autoIndex": true,
    "deltaInterval": "EVERY_15_MINUTES"
  }'
```

### Check Delta Tasks

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/dish/deltaTasks \
  -H "x-dish-access-token: your-secret-token"
```

### Cancel Delta Task

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/dish/deltaTasks/{taskId} \
  -H "x-dish-access-token: your-secret-token"
```

## üß™ Development Notes

* The `combine.py` script is provided to concatenate source files for auditing or documentation purposes.
* Use it to generate a readable `combined_output.txt` containing the full source.
* Delta feed schedules are lost on application restart (designed for simplicity).
* Container cleanup runs daily to prevent resource accumulation.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Authentication Errors**: Verify your Shopify PAT and Bloomreach API token are correct and have the required scopes
* **Processing Failures**: Check container logs for detailed error messages
* **Feed API Errors**: Ensure your Bloomreach account ID and catalog name are accurate
* **Empty Delta Feeds**: Normal behavior when no products have been updated since last run
* **Memory Issues**: Increase Docker memory allocation for large catalogs

### Delta Feed Specific Issues

* **Duplicate Products**: Check that date formats are correct (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00`)
* **Missing Updates**: Verify 30-second overlap is sufficient for your update frequency
* **Scheduling Issues**: Confirm cron expressions are valid and timezone-aware
